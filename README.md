# 1st_y_python_proj
These are projects I've created to sum up acquired knowledge during python course.
My first project is a simple algorithm that teaches user how to crochet based on their level.
It sums up my ability  to define and use a function, a conditional statement with else/elif block, loops, try-except.
My second project, creates a packing list for users. It shows my ability to create a graphical user interface, work with data from a file, create and use a list, dictionary, loops, conditional statements, functions.
