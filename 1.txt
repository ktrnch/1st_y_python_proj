Magic ring:
    Lay the tail end of the yarn against your open hand. Loop the working end of the yarn loosely around the first two fingers.
    Working from right to left, slide the crochet hook under the right-hand piece of yarn and over the left-hand piece. Grab the left-hand yarn and pull up a loop.
    Using your hook, grab the left-hand piece of yarn again, and pull it through the loop on the hook. Chain 1 (if doing SC)
    Make your first round of stitches into the ring. Insert the hook into the magic ring, and draw up a loop to begin your first SC. (You will be crocheting over the loop and the yarn tail.) Complete the SC as usual. Continue making stitches until you have the required number for your pattern.
